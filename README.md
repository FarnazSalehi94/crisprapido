# CRISPRapido
![CRISPRapido Logo](crisprapido.png)

CRISPRapido is a reference-free tool for comprehensive detection of CRISPR off-target sites using complete genome assemblies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on reference genomes and variant files, CRISPRapido directly analyzes haplotype-resolved assemblies to identify potential off-targets arising from any form of genetic variation. By leveraging efficient approximate string matching algorithms and parallel processing, CRISPRapido enables fast scanning of whole genomes while considering both mismatches and DNA/RNA bulges. The tool is particularly valuable for therapeutic applications, where comprehensive off-target analysis is critical for safety assessment. CRISPRapido can process both complete assemblies and raw sequencing data, providing flexibility for different analysis scenarios while maintaining high computational efficiency through its robust Rust implementation.

## Features
- Fast parallel scanning of genomic sequences
- Support for both gzipped and plain FASTA files
- Configurable mismatch and bulge tolerances
- Automatic reverse complement scanning
- PAF-format output compatible with downstream analysis tools
- Multi-threaded processing for improved performance
- CFD (Cutting Frequency Determination) scoring for off-targets

- `--no-filter`: Disable all filtering (report every alignment)

## Output Format
CRISPRapido outputs results in the Pairwise Alignment Format (PAF), which is widely used for representing genomic alignments. Each line represents a potential off-target site with the following tab-separated fields:

| Column | Field | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Query name | "Guide" (the guide RNA sequence) |
| 2 | Query length | Length of the guide RNA |
| 3 | Query start | 0-based start position in the guide sequence |
| 4 | Query end | 0-based end position in the guide sequence |
| 5 | Strand | '+' (forward) or '-' (reverse complement) |
| 6 | Target name | Reference sequence name (e.g., chromosome) |
| 7 | Target length | Length of the target reference sequence |
| 8 | Target start | 0-based start position in reference |
| 9 | Target end | 0-based end position in reference |
| 10 | Matches | Number of matching bases |
| 11 | Block length | Total alignment block length |
| 12 | Mapping quality | Always 255 for CRISPRapido |

Additionally, CRISPRapido includes these custom tags:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `as:i` | Alignment score (lower is better) |
| `nm:i` | Number of mismatches |
| `ng:i` | Number of gaps (indels) |
| `bs:i` | Biggest gap size in bases |
| `cg:Z` | CIGAR string representing alignment details |
| `cf:f` | CFD score |

### CFD Score
The Cutting Frequency Determination (CFD) score estimates the likelihood of a guide RNA cutting at an off-target site.
The score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0,  taking into account:
- Position-specific mismatch penalties
- PAM sequence efficiency
- Bulge and gap effects

This implementation requires two data files:
- `mismatch_scores.txt` : Position-specific mismatch penalties
- `pam_scores.txt` : Efficiency scores for different PAM sequences

**CFD Score Implementation Source**
The CFD score calculation in CRISPRapido is based on the Python implementation from the [CFD_score_calculator repository](https://github.com/lindayqlin/CFD_score_calculator) by Linda Lin. The algorithm has been ported to Rust and includes:
- Position-specific mismatch penalties for all 20 guide positions
- Comprehensive gap/bulge handling with position-specific penalties
- PAM sequence efficiency scoring
- Exact matching of the original Python implementation's behavior

### Example Output
```
Guide   20      0       20      +       chr1    248956422       10050   10070   19      21      255     as:i:6  nm:i:1  ng:i:0  bs:i:0  cg:Z:19=1X  cf:f:0.0549
```
This indicates:
- A 20bp guide RNA aligned to chromosome 1
- Position 10050-10070 on the forward strand
- 19 bases match with 1 mismatch (nm:i:1)
- No gaps (ng:i:0)
- Alignment score of 6 (as:i:6)
- CIGAR string shows 19 matches followed by 1 mismatch

## Known Issues

### Memory usage explodes with large guide batches
- **Observed behavior:** jobs that include tens of thousands of guides (e.g., 124 k gRNAs) steadily increase their resident memory (RES) until the scheduler’s OOM killer terminates the process (`Killed`). Running the same setup with only a few thousand guides completes successfully.
- **Why it happens:** the current implementation materializes every guide and every `(guide, contig)` pair in memory and keeps per-hit data (guide copies, reverse complements, target slices, CIGAR strings) until the entire run finishes. With hundreds of thousands of guides, these vectors consume multiple GB of RAM even before Rayon starts processing.
- **How to reproduce:**
  1. Build the release binary: `cargo build --release`.
  2. Prepare a large guide file (≥100 k sequences) and a genome FASTA.
  3. Run `./target/release/crisprapido -r <assembly.fa> -gfile <124k_guides.txt> -p GG -t <threads>` and monitor `RES` via `htop`/`ps`. Memory climbs continuously and the job eventually prints `Killed` once the server exhausts RAM.
- **Workarounds:**
  - Split the guides file into smaller batches and run CRISPRapido per chunk, concatenating the PAF outputs afterward.
  - Reduce `--threads` so Rayon keeps fewer worker-local buffers (helps only marginally compared to batching).
  - Request machines with significantly more RAM if a single monolithic run is required.

A long-term fix requires redesigning the pipeline so guides are streamed to workers (producer/consumer model) and hits are emitted immediately rather than stored globally. Until that refactor lands, plan on batching to avoid OOM kills.
